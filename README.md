## Project Goals


To create a fun & interactive environment for the user, where they can 'chill out' & play various brain games that I will hopefully develop.
I am going to continue the theme on from my first project about DJ Snooze-A-Lot & make it his fun website, as in "Welcome to DJ Snoooze-A-Lots Brain Rave"
I am going to try & make it seem like DJ Snooze-A-Lot is with you the whole time 'virtually', by possibly using a 'DJ Snooze-A-Lot Bot' .... by asking questions & refering to your logged in name.
Again, I just want people to have a laugh whether they were ravers, still are ravers (which we generally always are) or weren't even ravers back in the day.
I want this website to become mildly addictive were the user wants to come back regularly for more fun, by playing my games & listening to awesome tuneage !
